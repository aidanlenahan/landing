<p style="font-size: 1.4em;">I've walked many dogs over the years. All dogs I've walked all end up fed, watered, relieved, and happy, and hopefully your dog will too!</p>

<h1 style="font-size: 2em;">A bit about me:</h1>
<p style="font-size: 1.4em;">I'm an honors student at Red Bank Regional High School in the IT academy.<br>
<strong>I have three years of dog walking experience. I've walked around 15 dogs--big, small, calm, energetic, young, old, or even twice at once! From 20lbs to 120lbs!</strong><br>
I'm a lacrosse player, a runner, and a dog walker.<br>
I'm available most of the week and weekends. Please email me if you are in need of service!<br>
