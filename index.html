        Above, you can see a selection of the dogs I've walked over the years. The dogs in these pictures all are very happy with me, and hopefully, your dog will be too! To see other dogs, <a href="./index.html">reload</a> this page.<br><br>Email me for dog walking, and I'll display your dog up here too!<br>

      <h4 class="it-desc"><b>A bit about me:</b></h4><p>I'm an honors student at Red Bank Regional in the IT academy.
	I'm a lacrosse player, a varsity runner, and a dog walker.
        I have played the piano for around 10 years now, songs ranging from classic rock to classical.
	I've had a love of technology for as long as I can remember, which has now turned into a career path. 
      <h4 class="it-desc"><b>Experience:</b></h4>
      <p>I have walked close to 30 dogs now. I've been walking dogs since
      2021 now, and love every moment of it. It's very rewarding, as I truely
      have a love for dogs. I've walked dogs as heavy as 120 lbs, and as light as 10 lbs. Reviews coming soon! <br><br></p>
