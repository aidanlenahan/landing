      <h4 class="it-desc"><b>About me:</b></h4><p>I'm an junior, honors student at Red Bank Regional in the IT academy.
	I'm a lacrosse player, a varsity runner, and a dog walker.
        I have played the piano for a long time now, which has developed with my love for music.
	I've had a passion for technology for as long as I can remember, which has turned into a career path. 
      <h4 class="it-desc"><b>Experience:</b></h4>
      <p><strong>Since 2021, I've walked close to 40 dogs</strong>, and have loved every moment of it. It's very rewarding, as I truely
      have a love for dogs. I've walked dogs as heavy as 120 lbs, and as many as 4 at a time! <br><br></p>
